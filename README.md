I started off with a giraffe in the middle of the savannah.
In a first step, I placed the giraffe in the middle of a city center (image 1).
Then refined this to be photorealistic (image 2).
I got the best result placing it on a photorealistic sandy beach (image 3).

Replacing the subject instead of the background proved to be much trickier. Somehow, I couldn't get rid of the giraffe's legs. I tried to replace it with a red post box, and the leaning tower of Pisa. (images 4 and 5). 

So instead, I figured let's go with something that is supposed to have four legs, if the model so stubbornly wants to keep the legs. I chose an elephant and the result is quite amusing (image 6). I also got similar results with a dinosaur (image 7). Negative-prompting "giraffe" was something I tried, but it did not help, it would just delete the giraffe's body and keep the legs. (image 8).

I also tried a different image that proved to be a simpler task for the model, replacing a cat with a dog. I'm sure the simple background helped a lot. (image 9).
